This is a custom version of Ole Eskild Steensen's work. Please go to their [repository](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) instead.

I have modified the plugin to work with my own workflow. I have also added a few features that I found useful.

It helps power my own [notes site](https://notes.bagerbach.com).
